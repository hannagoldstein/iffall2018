		<p><h2>Plesiosaur</h2></p>
		<p>In 1933 it was suggested that the creature "bears a striking resemblance to the supposedly extinct plesiosaur," a long-necked aquatic reptile which became extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. A popular explanation at the time, the following arguments have been made against it:</p>

		<p>Plesiosaurs were probably cold-blooded reptiles needing warm tropical waters; the average temperature of Loch Ness is only about 5.5&deg;C (42&deg;F). If the plesiosaurs were warm-blooded, they would require a food supply beyond that supplied by Loch Ness.</p>

		<p>In an October 2006 New Scientist article, "Why the Loch Ness Monster is no plesiosaur," Leslie Noe of the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge said: "The osteology of the neck makes it absolutely certain that the plesiosaur could not lift its head up swan-like out of the water."</p>
		<p>The loch is only about 10,000 years old, dating to the end of the last ice age. Before then, it was frozen for about 20,000 years.</p>
		<p>If creatures similar to plesiosaurs lived in Loch Ness they would be seen frequently, since they would have to surface several times a day to breathe.</p>
		<p>In response to these criticisms, Tim Dinsdale, Peter Scott and Roy Mackal postulate a trapped marine creature which evolved from a plesiosaur directly or by convergent evolution. Robert Rines explained that the "horns" in some sightings as breathing tubes (or nostrils), allowing it to breathe without breaking the surface.</p>

		<p><h2>Long-necked giant amphibian</h2></p>

		<p>R. T. Gould suggested a long-necked newt; Roy Mackal examined the possibility, giving it the highest score (88 percent) on his list of possible candidates.</p>

		<p><h2>Invertebrate</h2></p>

		<p>In 1968 F. W. (Ted) Holiday proposed that Nessie and other lake monsters, such as Morag, may be a large invertebrate such as a bristleworm; he cited the extinct Tullimonstrum as an example of the shape. According to Holiday, this explains the land sightings and the variable back shape; he likened it to the medieval description of dragons as "worms."" Although this theory was considered by Mackal, he found it less convincing than eels, amphibians or plesiosaurs.</p></div>
