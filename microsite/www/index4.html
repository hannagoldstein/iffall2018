		<p>In 1980 Swedish naturalist and author Bengt Sjogren wrote that present beliefs in lake monsters such as the Loch Ness Monster are associated with kelpie legends. According to Sjogren, accounts of loch monsters have changed over time; originally describing horse-like creatures, they were intended to keep children away from the loch. Sjogren wrote that the kelpie legends have developed into descriptions reflecting a modern awareness of plesiosaurs.</p>

		<p>The kelpie as a water horse in Loch Ness was mentioned in an 1879 Scottish newspaper, and inspired Tim Dinsdale's Project Water Horse. A study of pre-1933 Highland folklore references to kelpies, water horses and water bulls indicated that Ness was the loch most frequently cited.</p>

		<p>On 6 December 1933 the first purported photograph of the monster, taken by Hugh Gray, was published in the Daily Express; the Secretary of State for Scotland soon ordered police to prevent any attacks on it. In 1934, interest was further piqued by the "surgeon's photograph." That year, R. T. Gould published an account of the author's investigation and a record of reports predating 1933. Other authors have claimed sightings of the monster dating to the sixth century AD.</p></div>
