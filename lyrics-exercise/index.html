The lights go out and I can't be saved<p>
Tides that I tried to swim against<p>
Have brought me down upon my knees<p>
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing<p>
<br>
Come out of the things unsaid<p>
Shoot an apple off my head and then a<p>
Trouble that can't be named<p>
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing<p>
<br>
You are, you are<p>
<br>
Confusion that never stops<p>
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna<p>
Come back and take you home<p>
I could not stop, that you now know, singing<p>
<br>
Come out upon my seas<p>
Cursed missed opportunities am I<p>
A part of the cure<p>
Or am I part of the disease, singing<p>
<br>
You are, you are<p>
You are, you are<p>
You are, you are<p>
<br>
And nothing else compares<p>
Oh no nothing else compares<p>
And nothing else compares<p>
<br>
You are, you are<p>
<br>
Home, home, where I wanted to go<p>
Home, home, where I wanted to go<p>
Home, home, where I wanted to go (you are)<p>
Home, home, where I wanted to go (you are)<p>
